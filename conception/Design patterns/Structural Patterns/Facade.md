# Facade Design Pattern

Category : structural

A facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code.

The facade design pattern solves problems like :
- To make a complex subsystem easier to use, a simple interface should be provided for a set of interfaces in the subsystem.
- The dependencies on a subsystem should be minimized.

A facade encapsulates a complex subsystem behind a simple interface.
It hides much of the complexity and makes the subsystem easy to use.
