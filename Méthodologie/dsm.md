# Data Structure Matrix (DSM)

- The column shows the dependencies of the selected row/component.
- The row shows the dependencies on the selected row/component.
- The green component depends on the yellow component

![DSM example](images/DSM.png "DSM example")

For example if we focus on the component **Person**
- It has 11 + 7 + 2 components that depend on it. (all the green flags)
- It depends on 1 component which is the component **PersonDataConverter** (the yellow flag)
